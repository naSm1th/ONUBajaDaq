# ONU Baja DAQ

This project includes all of the software related to the 2017 senior design project for the Olivet Nazarene University SAE Baja Team. The team, which consists of Nathanael Smith, Ryan Rose, Gabe Sevigny, and Ryan Carl, has been tasked with creating a system to measure and record performance metrics for the Baja car during test runs. This will be accomplished with various peripheral sensors and a central logger unit running on a Raspberry Pi 3B.
